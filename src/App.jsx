Role: Front-End Developer / Team Member

Description:
Cookie Music is a seamless, ad-free, and user-interactive music streaming web application developed as part of a college mini project. Designed with a dark theme and clean UI, the app plays music directly from locally stored files without relying on any cloud-based services, ensuring fast and offline-compatible playback.

Key features include a dynamic slide bar for adjusting the playback timeline, a sleek user interface optimized for user experience, and Firebase Authentication for secure login and signup functionality. The app was built entirely using core web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”without React, focusing on hands-on fundamentals and pure DOM manipulation.

This project emphasized user experience, performance, and team collaboration, and laid the foundation for deeper understanding of client-side architecture and real-time user authentication.

Features:

Ad-free and smooth music playback from local files

Interactive music timeline slider

Fully responsive dark-themed UI

Firebase-based user authentication (login/signup)
